# Git Init
- The `Git init` command is used to create and empty Git repository.
-If you wanted to create a new directory and initialize a Git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
- Once inside a Git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md), [add](./add.md), [commit](./commit.md), [push](./push.md), and more.
- Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
